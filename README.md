"how do i add the cloned repositiory into my own GitHub?"
Make new repositiory, dont initalizd with readme etc. 
go terminal and cd to that folder on local, "getting-started-app"
then git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-github-username>/<your-repository-name>.git

shoulde see github url with git remote -v
if not git remote remove origin, and then remote add that correct one and check.
then git push -u origin main

trying to git add. and git commit -m "inital"
and then push, but it's just default as before i changed to the clone.
so just change the new files here. Maybe next time find out how to chnage within local clone and uploda whole updates.

so clone, add to repository, edit files on github.
